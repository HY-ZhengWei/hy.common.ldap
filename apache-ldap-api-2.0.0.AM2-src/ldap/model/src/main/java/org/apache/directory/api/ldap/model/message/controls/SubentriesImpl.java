/**
 * A simple Subentries Control implementation. This control is described in 
 * RFC 3672 :
 *    The subentries control MAY be sent with a searchRequest to control
 *    the visibility of entries and subentries which are within scope.
 *    Non-visible entries or subentries are not returned in response to the
 *    request.
 * 
 *    The subentries control is an LDAP Control whose controlType is
 *    1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.10.1, criticality is TRUE or FALSE (hence absent),
 *    and controlValue contains a BER-encoded BOOLEAN indicating
 *    visibility.  A controlValue containing the value TRUE indicates that
 *    subentries are visible and normal entries are not.  A controlValue
 *    containing the value FALSE indicates that normal entries are visible
 *    and subentries are not.
 * 
 *    Note that TRUE visibility has the three octet encoding { 01 01 FF }
 *    and FALSE visibility has the three octet encoding { 01 01 00 }.
 * 
 *    The controlValue SHALL NOT be absent.
 * 
 *    In absence of this control, subentries are not visible to singleLevel
 *    and wholeSubtree scope Search requests but are visible to baseObject
 *    scope Search requests.
 * 
 *    There is no corresponding response control.
 * 
 *    This control is not appropriate for non-Search operations.
