/**
 * An extended operation intended for notifying clients of upcoming
 * disconnection. Here's what <a
 * href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2251.html">RFC 2251</a> has to say about
 * it:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  Section 4.1.1 (Small snippet on sending NoD)
 *  
 *     If the server receives a PDU from the client in which the LDAPMessage
 *     SEQUENCE tag cannot be recognized, the messageID cannot be parsed,
 *     the tag of the protocolOp is not recognized as a request, or the
 *     encoding structures or lengths of data fields are found to be
 *     incorrect, then the server MUST return the notice of disconnection
 *     described in section 4.4.1, with resultCode protocolError, and
 *     immediately close the connection. In other cases that the server
 *     cannot parse the request received by the client, the server MUST
 *     return an appropriate response to the request, with the resultCode
 *     set to protocolError.
 *     
 *  ...   
 *     
 *  4.4. Unsolicited Notification
 *  
 *     An unsolicited notification is an LDAPMessage sent from the server to
 *     the client which is not in response to any LDAPMessage received by
 *     the server. It is used to signal an extraordinary condition in the
 *     server or in the connection between the client and the server.  The
 *     notification is of an advisory nature, and the server will not expect
 *     any response to be returned from the client.
 *  
 *     The unsolicited notification is structured as an LDAPMessage in which
 *     the messageID is 0 and protocolOp is of the extendedResp form.  The
 *     responseName field of the ExtendedResponse is present. The LDAPOID
 *     value MUST be unique for this notification, and not be used in any
 *     other situation.
 *  
 *     One unsolicited notification is defined in this document.
 *  
 *  4.4.1. Notice of Disconnection
 *  
 *     This notification may be used by the server to advise the client that
 *     the server is about to close the connection due to an error
 *     condition. Note that this notification is NOT a response to an
 *     unbind requested by the client: the server MUST follow the procedures
 *     of section 4.3. This notification is intended to assist clients in
 *     distinguishing between an error condition and a transient network
 *     failure. As with a connection close due to network failure, the
 *     client MUST NOT assume that any outstanding requests which modified
 *     the directory have succeeded or failed.
 *  
 *     The responseName is 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.20036, the response field is
 *     absent, and the resultCode is used to indicate the reason for the
 *     disconnection.
 *  
 *     The following resultCode values are to be used in this notification:
 *  
 *     - protocolError: The server has received data from the client in
 *       which the LDAPMessage structure could not be parsed.
 *  
 *     - strongAuthRequired: The server has detected that an established
 *       underlying security association protecting communication between
 *       the client and server has unexpectedly failed or been compromised.
 *  
 *     - unavailable: This server will stop accepting new connections and
 *       operations on all existing connections, and be unavailable for an
 *       extended period of time. The client may make use of an alternative
 *       server.
 *  
 *     After sending this notice, the server MUST close the connection.
 *     After receiving this notice, the client MUST NOT transmit any further
 *     on the connection, and may abruptly close the connection.
 * </pre>
